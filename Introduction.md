# Introduction to 8:3 Priority Encoder

## Overview

This project showcases the **8:3 Priority Encoder**, a fundamental digital logic circuit. A Priority Encoder is designed to handle multiple simultaneous inputs, but unlike standard encoders, it prioritizes the highest-indexed active input. 
This makes it a crucial component in systems requiring signal management and prioritization.

## Why a Priority Encoder?

In real-world applications, input signals don't always appear in isolation. There are scenarios where multiple signals are activated concurrently, and processing all of them simultaneously could lead to ambiguity or system errors. 
The **Priority Encoder** solves this issue by assigning a priority level to each input. When multiple inputs are in a high logic state (active), the circuit will only encode the input with the highest priority, ignoring the others.

In an **8:3 Priority Encoder**, there are 8 input data lines and 3 output data lines. These three output lines will display the binary code corresponding to the index of the highest-priority active input. 
Additionally, the circuit typically includes an **Enable** or **Valid** output (often referred to as `GS` - Group Select or `V` - Valid) to indicate whether any input is currently active.

## Typical Applications

* **Interrupt Controllers:** In computer systems, when multiple devices send interrupt requests simultaneously, a Priority Encoder helps determine which device has the highest priority and needs to be serviced first.
* **Resource Management:** Allocating resources or access rights based on priority levels.
* **Address Decoders:** In some memory architectures, they can be used to determine the accessed memory region.
* **Control Systems:** Ensuring critical signals are processed with higher priority.
